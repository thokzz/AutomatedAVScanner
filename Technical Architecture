Key Components
1. User Interface Layer
Built entirely with SwiftUI, the UI layer consists of:

ContentView: Main container view with tab navigation
ScanView: Real-time display of connected drives and scan status
TransactionHistoryView: Displays historical scan records
SettingsView: Configuration options for scanning behavior
ThemeSettingsView: Visual theme customization
The UI employs the @ObservedObject and @StateObject patterns to maintain a reactive interface that updates automatically as underlying data changes.

2. Coordination Layer
This layer manages the orchestration of the application's features:

AppCoordinator: Central coordinator that manages the application state and coordinates between subsystems
TransactionManager: Handles the persistence and retrieval of scan records
ScanHandler: Coordinates the scanning process
PhysicalDriveTracker: Associates partitions with their physical drives
DriveEjectHandler: Manages the safe ejection process
3. Core Functionality Layer
The components that implement the primary features:

VolumeMonitor: Detects drive connection and disconnection events
ScanEngine: Interfaces with ClamAV to perform virus scanning
FileCounter: Accurately counts and estimates files on volumes
PrintManager: Handles receipt printing to connected printers
AudioCueManager: Provides audio feedback for key operations
AuditLogger: Maintains a detailed log of all operations
4. System Integration Layer
Low-level components that interface with macOS services:

ClamAV Integration: Shell script wrappers and process management
Disk API Integration: For volume monitoring and ejection
Printing System Integration: For automated report printing
Concurrency Model
DriveScanner utilizes Swift's modern concurrency features:

Swift Concurrency: Uses Swift's async/await and Task for non-blocking operations
Actor Isolation: Key components like ScanState are implemented as actors to ensure thread safety
MainActor: UI updates are explicitly performed on the main actor
Example from ScanHandler.swift:

swift
@MainActor
final class ScanHandler {
    func startScanning(
        volume: ExternalVolume,
        state: VolumeScanState,
        autoPrintEnabled: Bool,
        // ...
    ) -> Task<Void, Never> {
        return Task {
            do {
                // Asynchronous operations with await
                let fileCount = try await fileCounter.countFiles(in: volume) { count in
                    Task { @MainActor in
                        // UI updates on main actor
                        state.fileCount = count
                        state.fileCountRange = "\(state.minFileCount)-\(state.maxFileCount)"
                    }
                }
                // ...
            } catch {
                // Error handling
            }
        }
    }
}
Data Flow
Data flows through the application in the following sequence:

Drive Detection: VolumeMonitor detects new drives
Coordination: AppCoordinator initiates the scan process
Scanning: ScanHandler delegates to FileCounter and ScanEngine
Results Processing: Scan results are collected and stored
Notification: System is notified of scan completion
Printing: PrintManager prints results report
Ejection: DriveEjectHandler safely ejects the drive
State Management
The application uses a combination of state management approaches:

ObservableObject Pattern: Core state containers implement ObservableObject
Published Properties: Key state variables use @Published for UI reactivity
State Propagation: Changes propagate through the coordination layer
Persistent State: TransactionManager persists state across app launches
Error Handling
Robust error handling is implemented throughout:

Structured Error Types: Domain-specific error types for clear error categorization
Graceful Degradation: Fallback behaviors when operations fail
User Feedback: Visual and audio cues inform the user of issues
Logging: Comprehensive logging for diagnostic purposes
Extensibility Points
The architecture provides several extensibility points:

Scan Engine: The ClamAV integration could be replaced with another engine
Theme System: New themes can be added by extending the theme definitions
File Filtering: The extension filtering system is configurable
Security Considerations
Security is paramount in a virus scanning application:

Sandboxing: Operation within macOS security boundaries
Entitlements: Precise entitlements for necessary functionality
Secure Resources: Careful management of secure-scoped bookmarks
Update Mechanism: Secure update pathway for virus definitions
Implementation Challenges and Solutions
Multi-Partition Drive Handling
Challenge: Coordinating scanning across multiple partitions of the same physical drive.

Solution: The PhysicalDriveTracker associates partitions with their physical drives using BSD device identifiers. When all partitions have been scanned, the system triggers the safe ejection process.

Reliable Printing
Challenge: Ensuring reliable printing across various printer models and macOS versions.

Solution: The PrintManager implements multiple fallback strategies and retry mechanisms to handle printing edge cases, particularly on macOS Monterey.

Audio Feedback Reliability
Challenge: Audio cues sometimes failing to play, especially on macOS Monterey.

Solution: The AudioCueManager implements a sophisticated fallback system with multiple playback attempts and system sound fallbacks when primary audio playback fails.

Performance Optimizations
Several performance optimizations are employed:

Incremental File Processing: Large volumes are processed incrementally
Selective Scanning: Configurable extension filtering to skip safe file types
Concurrent Operations: Parallel operations where appropriate
Resource Limiting: Careful management of system resources
Conclusion
DriveScanner's architecture demonstrates thoughtful design patterns and Swift best practices, with particular attention to:

Clean separation of concerns
Modern Swift concurrency
Robust error handling
Graceful degradation
Deep system integration
This architecture enables the application to provide a seamless, reliable scanning experience while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
